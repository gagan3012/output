 Confidential Memeratum.

This in Vancouver during the months of May and June

of the present year,I was informed by Dr.A.S.Morno,Medical

Inspector and Immigration agent of the Dominion Government,

that he was strongly of the opinion that a number of the East

Indians who have come to Comada within the past year or two

years,are at the present time co-operating with some of the

natives in India who are interested in sowing seeds of condition

in India. At Dr.Morno's office I met Ms.T.O.Mopkinson,who

has lived some twenty-five years in India,end who,for a good

portion of that time,has been connected with the Indian Police

(in Caloutta,I think). He knows a number of the Indians well,

and is able to converse freely with most of those who have come

to this country. He informed no that he was of the opinion

that money was being raised in Vancouver and the United States

to send to India to help along the nationalist association

there. He went so far as to say that he had reason for believing that instructions as to the method of manufacturing bombs

had boom sent from Indians residing at Seattle to some of their

follow-country in India. The person whose movements he

thought should receive special attention,is one Teraokhnath Das,

the editor of a paper published in Vancouver,called "The Free

Hindusthan. This man makes his headquarters at Vancouver,and

than for a time at Seattle,coing to and fro considerably between

these places. Ms.Hopkinson was of the opinion that if the mail

coming to Teraokhnath Das and to some of the Indians living at

Port Moody,were siosed and opened,it would show that his

impressions were correct. As far as I was able to learn,

Teraokhnath Das was for a time a student at Berkeley University,

Galifornia,and was employed by the United States Immigration -2-

Offico in Vancouver as an interpreter. I was informed that he had been suspended,pending some investigation of his actions.

I also not,in Dr.Momro's office,Ihr.O.J.Brooke,who for many years resided in Caloutta,and who acted as an interpreter for me in connection with the enquiry conducted last fall,into the methods by which Oriental labourers have been induced to some to Canada. Nr.Brooke gave it as his opinion that Teraokmath

has was one of a band of omnipricators,who were sending to India

both money and seditious literature to help along a revolution

in that country.

Dr.P.Undenhill,Medical Health Officer of the City

of Vancouver,shared the opinions of Mr.Hopkinson and Mr.Brooke.

It seemed for me a copy of the first number of "The Free

Hindusthen,and with him I visited the quarters of the Hindus

residing in the City of Vancouver. Dr.Undenhill was of the

opinion that Uday Ram,who was a foreman in the lumber mills at

Millside,was a person whose operations would stand a little

looking into. He virtually controls the employment of Hindus

at the mills at Millside,and all payments of money made to them

pass through his hands. Dr.Undenhill did not say that Uday Ram

was in any way connected with siditious movements,but I under-

stood from him,as well as from Mr.Brooke and Mr.Hopkinson,that

he was one of a group of men at Millside who were associated with

Teraokmath Des. It was Uday Ram who sent to the Right Honourable

the Visount Morley,Soretuary of State for India a cablegram

which was received at the India Office while I was in England,

and which was as follows:

"Vancouver,March 28,I208.

"Mans meeting Natives of India protestportation

exclusion from Canada. British subjects claim Government protection throughout the Empire. If our interest

ourlocked,brothers in India must necessarily resent your

 Government's neglect."

Ily own personal opinion is that Uday Ram and his uncle, Davidson, a Brahmin,who was in British Columbia for some little time prior to the large influx of Indians last year,hwe been responsible for a good deal of the immigration from India. Davidson,from all I can learn of him,is a good deal of an adventurer. He has been some years in Australias,as well as two years in Canada. The impression he created among the authorities in British Columbia was anything but favourable. The London Times of May 22 contained an article from its special correspondent at Vancouver,in which it was stated that there were good reasons for believing that a fictitious movement in India was being directed from the Pacific Coast. The correspondent said:

"I have positive information that Indians here are subscribing money for secitious purposes, and I have other information which indicates that Millside,near Nor Westminster,is a centre of revolutionary agitation. There is a certain 'school' there, ostensibly for the instruction of Indians in English. which is actually being managed by activators for the purpose of imbuing Sikks with revolutionary ideas. The treatment which Indians are receiving here naturally makes them receptive of such doctrines. The 'school' is under the direction of three Indians,one from the Punjab and two from Bengal,who are well educated. The movement has spread to Seattle,which town the most dangerous of the three asitators is now visiting. This man is a Bongali,and recently started a paper called 'Pres Hindusthan.' A groes's shop on Granville Street Vancouver,is being used for the exchange of letters between the asitators here and their friends in India. I am informed that directions for making bombs were recently sent from the Pacific Coast to India.' Hr.L.F.Grippen is the correspondant of The Times in the City of Vancouver,and is living at the Hotel Vancouver in that city. He informed me that he himself had sent this despatch.

The Vancouver News-Advertiser of June II contains a reply to the despatch to The London Times,written by Trankmatch Das,who signs himself as 'Editor of The Free Hindusthen.' It begins by asserting that the London Times "is ever notorious for misrepresenting facts,especially where the interests of Wheauernoy is supremo,and the rights of men are most abuseively ignored." In his lotter Das freely admits the publication of The Free Hindusthen,saying that it "advocates the liberal principle of rights of man and puts forth undomiable facts and figures about the exploiting principles of the British Government in Hindusthen." Beforening to the sending of directions for making bombs from the Pacific Gonst it says: "I shall say that there is no lack of eminent chemists in India,and if we could be successful in sending a formula for making bombs,it would be a great credit to us,that notwithstanding the opening of letters sent from this country,we manned to send the abnoxious message to India."

In this article Das has a reference which is evidently intended for Mr-Hopkinson,and is as follows: "The infomment is an Anglo-Indian,and he was in India over 89 years,and to him,as it is to mostly all Anglo-Indians,all educational movement is a red reg to a bull,because it is the policy of the British Government in India to keep the people in ismoreno and exploit the country,and the infomment is quite aware of the policy,owing to his long stay in India and seoret connection with the Burentuernoy." Das admits the existence of a school in Vancouver,and says in reference to it: "Ganda as a free country makes every Hindu undorstand how he is expressed at home. We teach not only how to read and write English,but toll them about their rights,and shall do,as far as I am concerned,right along. It is my duty and shall stick to it till the last. It is an open secret that I chorish,that the Government of India must be a Government of the people of India,by the people of India,and for the people of India,and 'Free Hindusthem' represents this idea."

The concluding paragraphs of this letter are as follows:

"Our contemporary also mentioned that we are attempting to make the Sikhs embittered with revolutionary ideas. We think it will not be out of place to mention that there was a serious riot at

Punjab last year,and it was the retired Sikh soldiers who were more concerned in it,and the riot took place when the land tax was heavily increased. If the British Government in India is all right,then there is no danger of the people taking notion. If it is not, then the people will assert their rights.

"Lastly I may say that the national movement in India will not be checked by threatening remarks of him or any of his co-workers.

"The progression of the British Government in India will make the people more aggressive in their efforts to secure self-government. That is all India wants. She is not revolutionary,and when she is accepted the privilege of governing herself there will be no friction with the head of the Empire of which she form a part."

The first number of "The Free Hindusthem was published in April of the present year. It is described as "An organ of freedom,and of political,social and religious reform,and its motio, "Rosistance to tyranny is obedience to God." In the first number is contained the cable sent to the Right Nonourable -Y-

Lord Morley,before quoted,and says that Uday Rem at Millside

bore the expense of sending the cable. The nature of this

publication may be judged from the following headings of the

chief articles which it contains:

"A Strong Protest against British Justice."

"Our National Life is at Stake."

"Yamine in Hindusthan and the Only Remedy."

"The Russian Measures in Hindusthan."

"A Lesson from the German Revolution of IS49."

The following are passages from among the articles

which "The Pres Hindusthan" contains:

"Today our national life is at stake. The British

 Government in India has already adopted all possible

regressive measures to crush our national aspirations;

and a new measure is going to be adopted which will

lead our national life to stagnation. To are always

in our country and have no voices in the government of

our country far from having any representation of our

own. To are treated worse than outs and doing of English-

men in the British Colonies. Today the door off

Hindusthan is open to the hungry Britishers and other

colonists who are wrongfully robbing our nation while

millions are yearly starving to death.

"Let us tell,in an active way,to the British

government,that if we are not allowed to enter

British Colonies,Enitihers will sooner or later be

excluded from Hindusthan. The treatment we get in

British Columbia is heart-rending. We cannot set

houses to rent. They say 've will rent houses to the

Ghinos,Japanese,Norcos,but not to the Hindus,though

they fought for the British flag." "To fear another sort of injustice may bring the news of an upheaval which will rend the Empire into pieces."

"Then hor many millions are there out of relief,and how many thousands are daily dying of starvation! The civilized world knows very little of it,because Hindusthen is represented by the British bureaucuroney which can shindelessly trumpet that Great Britain is uplifting a population of three hundred millions,namely one-fifth of the population of the world,to the highest standard of civilization and prosperity while she is really using all her power to deritalise the nation by all means possible. The intersectionEnglish papers do not want to let the civilized world know the dark stains of the murderous commercial policy of Great Britain,which caused a mortality of over nineteen millions of people in femines alone during the last twenty-five years,while the British merchants exported hundreds of tons of rioo,wheat and other kinds of staple food daily during the very days of femine in the country.

"Femine in Hindusthen is mechanically erected by the British Government and capitalists in their greediness to rob the nation's under a hundred and one pretexts.

"What is the true cause of femine in Hindusthen is the question,and to answer it I should say that the poverty of the Indian pensightry,which is 85 per cent of the total population,is the true and only cause. And this poverty is created by the British Government by her unjust and meroiless taxation,wilful destruction of native industries,oxorbitant military expenditure. and many other mechanical processes of draining away an incredibly large sum of money from our beloved mother country every year without giving back a cont in return."

"To stop femines in Hindusthem we have to stop the draining of the wealth of the country by the British government and her commercial policy. This can only be done by taking the reims of the government @I our own country in our hands.

"The repressive measures adopted by the British Government in Hindusthem to curb the national ampiratin of the people is daily revolutionizing the people. The civilized world hates the Russian measures,but it is really unknown to the world that the British Government has adopted measures in Hindusthem in no way inferior to those of the Russian bureaucracy."

The following passage referring to immigration from India to Canada is simifificent as showing wherein,in the opinion of the leaders of the nationalist movement,immigration from India to Canada will assist their cause. It suggests that there may be an even deeper significance to part of the move. ment than the authorities have hitherto supposed:

"The ask our leaders at home to take all possible steps to arouse the feeling of the masses so that the proposed step to stop immigration to Canada may not be passed. This not,once passed,will serve as a cause of stagnation of our national life." It will be fully apparent that persons desiring to use any city or part of Canada as headquarters for seditious proposals in India,are not a desirable class of immigrants to have in this country. It supplies an additional reason for the careful supervision of all immigration from India to Canada.
